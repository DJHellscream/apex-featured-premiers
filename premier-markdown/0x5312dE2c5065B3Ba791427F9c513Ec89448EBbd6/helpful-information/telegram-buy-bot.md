A Telegram BuyBot can now be added to your Telegram Group. There's just a few simple steps to add it for your token.

These actions can only be performed by the Group owner/admins.

* Add @ApexSwapBot to your group
* Give the bot the admin role
* Use the command "/monitor 0x3472b9658d33B29CdfCc1Cbc4Fec65e2287844c2" (Replace with your token address)
* /setIndicator \<Dollar Value> \<emoji>
  * This will put an emoji (up to 50) for every $\<Dollar Value> of the token purchase.
* /uploadImage&#x20;
  * \-> hit enter&#x20;
  * \-> bot will request image&#x20;
  * \-> drop image into chat
  * This will provide a banner image for each buy.

You can change the bot settings by using those commands at any time to update it.

Reminder: This bot is in beta and still in development. Therefore, there could be unexpected downtime.
