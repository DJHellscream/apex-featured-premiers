# BENSI Premier

Welcome to the Bensi Box Premier launch of $BENSI. Bensi Box is a Real World Art Tokenization and Fractionalization platform built on Avalanche. Learn more about the $BENSI memecoin below.

## Premier & LP Tokens

APEX Premier enables $BENSI to be a fair launched art memecoin on the Avalanche Blockchain. The initial liquidity pool for the $BENSI memecoin will be added to Apex and Pharaoh Exchange. All LP tokens managed by the Foundation will be locked in the $BENSI Memecoin Moat after launch.

## Treasury Tokens

The Bensi Box Treasury is a strategic reserve of tokens and assets for the Bensi Box Foundation to manage. The treasury allocation of the $BENSI memecoin makes up 45% of the total supply. The treasury allocation of the memecoin will be used to bolster the ecosystem; incentivizing traders, collectors, and participants in our fractionalization program with airdrops, marketing efforts, exchange listings, acquire new artworks, and more. The Treasury Multisig address is the same address as the presale address. Airdrops make up 20% of the total $BENSI allocation, which is approximately 45% of the total Treasury allocation.

## Foundation Tokens

The Foundation will receive 5% of the total supply of $BENSI memecoin. The Foundation Multisig address will be made public and trackable.
