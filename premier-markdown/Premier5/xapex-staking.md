# ðŸ¦ˆ xAPEX Staking

## **Earn AVAX Revenue from Apex Platform Activities**

`xAPEX Staking` is designed to provide APEX holders with a unique opportunity to earn AVAX rewards directly from the platform's revenue streams. By staking `xAPEX`, users gain access to a share of the AVAX revenue generated from two key sources: **DEX swaps** and the **Apex Burst** token launchpad. Below, we explain how this works, its benefits, and why staking `xAPEX` is an integral part of the Apex ecosystem.

#### **Key Features**

* **Native AVAX Rewards:**\
  Stakers earn rewards in AVAX, collected dynamically from Apex's revenue-generating features.
* **Two Revenue Sources:**
  * **DEX Swaps:** Fees generated from trades on the Apex decentralized exchange are allocated as staking rewards.
  * **Apex Burst:** Revenue from the Apex Burst token launchpad is streamed directly into the staking contract.
* **Dynamic Distribution:**\
  Rewards are distributed proportionally to usersâ€™ stakes in real time, ensuring fairness and simplicity.
* **Composability:**\
  As an ERC4626 token, `xAPEX` integrates seamlessly into DeFi protocols, enabling holders to leverage their tokens while continuing to earn rewards.

#### **How It Works**

**Staking `xAPEX`**

1. **Deposit:**\
   Users stake their `xAPEX` tokens into the staking contract, which tracks their contribution.
2. **Rewards Accumulation:**
   * The contract dynamically updates reward balances whenever AVAX is streamed from DEX swaps or Apex Burst.
   * The accumulated rewards are shared among stakers based on their proportional stake.
3. **Claim or Compound:**
   * Users can claim their AVAX rewards at any time.
   * Alternatively, they can leave their rewards unclaimed, earning additional benefits as the staking pool grows.

**Revenue Sources**

* **DEX Swaps:**
  * A portion of fees collected from Apex DEX trades is converted to AVAX and sent to the staking contract.
  * This ensures a consistent and sustainable flow of rewards for stakers.
* **Apex Burst:**
  * Apex Burst generates revenue from token launches, with a portion allocated as AVAX rewards for `xAPEX` stakers.

#### **Example Workflow**

**Alice stakes 1,000 xAPEX:**

1. **Initial Stake:**\
   Alice deposits 1,000 `xAPEX` into the staking contract.
2. **Revenue Stream:**
   * Over the month, the Apex DEX generates 100 AVAX in fees, and Apex Burst contributes an additional 50 AVAX.
   * A total of 150 AVAX is streamed into the staking contract.
3. **Reward Distribution:**
   * Assuming Alice holds 10% of the total staked `xAPEX`, she receives 15 AVAX (10% of 150 AVAX).
   * She can claim her 15 AVAX or leave it unclaimed for later withdrawal.

#### **Benefits of Staking `xAPEX`**

1. **Earn Passive Income:**
   * By staking `xAPEX`, users earn a consistent share of AVAX rewards without any active management.
2. **Dual Revenue Streams:**
   * Rewards come from both DEX swaps and Apex Burst, diversifying the revenue sources for greater stability.
3. **Seamless Integration:**
   * `xAPEX`â€™s ERC4626 standard ensures composability with other DeFi protocols, enabling stakers to earn rewards while using their tokens elsewhere.
4. **Ecosystem Growth:**
   * As Apex expands, the revenue pool grows, increasing the potential rewards for stakers.

#### **Disclaimer**

Staking `xAPEX` involves risks, including market volatility and the performance of the Apex ecosystem. While rewards are designed to be proportional to the revenue generated by the platform, there is no guarantee of returns. Users should evaluate the risks and only stake what they can afford to lose.
