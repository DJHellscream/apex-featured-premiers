#### DEX Selection and Burst Allocation

Apex Burst empowers you to tailor your token launch by selecting the amount of AVAX or ETH required to trigger your tokenâ€™s "Burst." You can choose from a range of **50-2000 AVAX** or **2-100 ETH** to fund your tokenâ€™s liquidity.

**Balancing Liquidity Across DEXs**

When configuring your tokenâ€™s Burst, it's essential to consider how your chosen AVAX or ETH amount impacts liquidity distribution across DEXs. A lower amount of AVAX or ETH means you should allocate liquidity to fewer DEXs to maintain meaningful depth. Proper liquidity depth is critical to ensure participants can easily buy and sell your token without experiencing high price slippage.

**Example Scenario:**\
If you set your Burst amount at 50 AVAX, allocating liquidity across multiple DEXs may result in shallow pools that hinder trading. Instead, focusing on a single DEX ensures better depth and more efficient trading for your users.

**Liquidity Allocation Per DEX**

Apex Burst allows you to customize liquidity allocation across DEXs. While **Apex requires a minimum of 25% allocation**, the remaining liquidity can be distributed among other DEXs as you prefer. The total allocation must add up to **100%**, giving you the flexibility to prioritize and support your favorite platforms.

Additionally, you can choose which DEXâ€™s LP tokens will serve as staking rewards in the single-sided staking pool after your token bursts. For every DEX allocation:

* **Reward DEX LP Tokens**: Allocated to the single-sided staking contract for users to earn.
* **Non-Reward DEX LP Tokens**: Sent to a burn address, permanently locking liquidity and creating long-term token stability.

**Strategic Benefits of Liquidity Distribution**

The flexibility in selecting the reward DEX provides you with strategic control over your tokenomics:

1. **Maximize Staking Rewards:**\
   Allocate the DEX with the highest liquidity to the staking pool. This gives users higher APRs, incentivizing participation in the pool while locking less liquidity permanently.
2. **Boost Long-Term Liquidity Stability:**\
   Allocate the DEX with a smaller liquidity percentage to the staking pool. This approach creates lower APRs but results in a greater amount of liquidity being burned, contributing to a more deflationary and stable liquidity structure for your token.
