# ðŸŒŠ Burst

**Apex Burst** is a feature of the Apex platform, created to simplify the process of creating, collecting, and trading meme or vanity tokens in a peer-to-peer (P2P) environment. Apex Burst operates fully on the blockchain, meaning it does not issue, hold, or exchange tokens on your behalf. You retain control over your tokens within your wallet, relying on blockchain technology for their security.

Itâ€™s essential to remember that Apex Burst is not an investment platform. Meme tokens can lose value at any time, so only collect or trade tokens within your risk tolerance.

Additionally, when creating a token, creators agree to avoid any statements that might mislead buyers into expecting financial returns, which could imply the sale of a security. For instance, creators should not promise actions to increase token value. Enjoy the experience for what it isâ€”a fun and fair way to engage with meme token trading on a decentralized platform.

Apex Burst is committed to providing a customizable, streamlined and transparent experience for meme token enthusiasts and creators!
