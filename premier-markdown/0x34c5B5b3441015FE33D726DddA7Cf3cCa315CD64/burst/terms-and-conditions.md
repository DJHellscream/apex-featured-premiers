# ℹ️ Terms and Conditions

**1. How It Works**\
Apex Burst is the go-to platform to discover and launch new tokens ("Collections") with complete transparency. Each token creation follows a fair launch model—no pre-sales, no insider trading, and no manipulative practices. Collections on Apex Burst are designed with a fixed supply determined by the creator, and once created, tokens operate autonomously on the blockchain, with supply and transfer rules governed by the blockchain protocol. This means that neither Apex Burst nor token creators can alter token dynamics or block users from trading. However, as with all tokens, values may fluctuate unpredictably, and participants bear the full risk of financial losses.

If Apex Burst identifies suspicious or fraudulent activities associated with a token, we reserve the right to modify or restrict access to that token on the platform, as deemed necessary.

**2. Binding Agreement**\
By using Apex Burst, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by these Terms of Use. If you do not agree, you must refrain from using Apex Burst. You also acknowledge that Apex Burst is not liable for any losses incurred.

You may not use Apex Burst if you:

* Are under the legal age to form a binding contract or below 18 years of age.
* Are located in a jurisdiction where the use of Apex Burst is prohibited or would subject us to any registration requirements within that jurisdiction.

**3. Accessing Apex Burst**\

* You will not mislead or misrepresent the value or utility of tokens.
* You will not engage in harmful, malicious, or disruptive activities, including the introduction of harmful code.

Once created, tokens are immutable on the blockchain, though Apex Burst reserves the right to limit a token's visibility on its platform.
