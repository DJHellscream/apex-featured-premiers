Notice Regarding Experimental Token Standard

The APEX platform enables users to deploy and trade tokens using the experimental ERC314 token standard. The APEX platform is merely an interface to decentralized contracts on the blockchain that facilitate users to perform transactions. Users should be aware that this token standard is still in development and may contain bugs or vulnerabilities that could affect the functionality and security of the tokens. The ERC314 standard is provided under an experimental basis, and all interactions with tokens using this standard are performed at the userâ€™s own risk.

**Important Points to Consider:**

* **Experimental Nature:** ERC314 is an experimental token standard and may undergo significant changes.
* **Potential Risks:** There may be undiscovered bugs or vulnerabilities in the ERC314 standard that could expose users to financial or security risks.
* **Community Contribution:** We encourage the community to participate in the ongoing development and enhancement of the ERC314 ecosystem to improve its robustness and functionality.

#### APEX's Role and Disclaimer on Token Endorsements

APEX does not endorse or recommend any tokens deployed on its platform by users unless explicitly stated. The responsibility to conduct due diligence on any token lies with the users themselves. APEX provides an interface to decentralized contracts on blockchains for token deployment and trading but is not responsible for the performance or compliance of any tokens created using its services.

**User Responsibility:**

* **Due Diligence:** Users are advised to thoroughly investigate and research tokens before engaging in transactions.
* **Awareness of Risks:** Users should be aware of the financial risks associated with trading digital assets, especially those associated with new and experimental token standards.

#### Fees and APR Adjustments

At Apex, we are committed to ensuring the health and sustainability of our ecosystem. To maintain this balance and adapt to changing market conditions, we reserve the right to adjust ecosystem fees and staking APRs without prior notification. These adjustments are made with the primary goal of benefiting the ecosystem as a whole, ensuring fair and optimal outcomes for all participants.

Our approach includes:

* **Ecosystem Fees**: Fees associated with various platform services may be adjusted periodically. This flexibility allows us to respond to market trends, operational costs, and user needs, ensuring that our services remain competitive and sustainable.
* **Staking APRs**: The Annual Percentage Rates (APRs) for staking rewards are subject to change. Adjustments to APRs help us manage the distribution of rewards and maintain the long-term viability of staking programs, balancing incentives for current participants with the growth of the ecosystem.

We are dedicated to transparent and fair practices and strive to make changes that align with the best interests of our users and the ecosystem. While changes may occur without prior notice, our goal is always to enhance the overall experience and sustainability of our platform.

#### Conclusion

By using the APEX platform, users acknowledge the experimental nature of the ERC314 token standard and assume all related risks. APEX is committed to providing a secure and reliable platform and encourages the community's involvement in enhancing the safety and functionality of this new token standard.
