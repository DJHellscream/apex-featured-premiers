Creating a token and having it be successful is a lot of Crypto enthusiast’s dream. We have put this together to give you some suggestions and tips on how to give yours a better chance of success. This is merely a guide and is no way the only way to launch your token.

**Token Idea**: Think of a name that is catchy and fun. Something that is currently in the news is also a great idea for a token. Develop a plan on how you want to build the community around this token. The token symbol is also important and should be considered.

**Marketing**: Promoting your token is very critical to its success. Simply making a token and hoping is seldom successful. You might have a great idea but if no one hears about it then it is likely to fail.

* X (Formerly known as Twitter), this is a powerful platform, and you should be ready to post and market your token here. Spaces on Twitter are also very powerful and get the word out.
* TG, creating a Telegram channel for your token is also a great way to build momentum for your token and develop a strong community.
* Partnerships, reaching out to established projects and providing a benefit to their community is a great way to enhance your project. This can be done in many ways and an airdrop is one idea.
* Website, as the token progresses a basic website is often a good idea. It’s another place where you can spread the word about your token and future plans

## Launching on APEX

Now that you have decided on your tokens name and symbol the tokens logo is important. A fun quality picture can go a long way. APEX requires a dimension of 150 x 150 pixel to represent your image.

**Supply**: When thinking of supply think how you want your token to be received. The larger the amount the lower cost your token will have. A lower supply can make your tokens demand go up as the limited supply could drive demand.

**Liquidity**: When adding liquidity to your token consider how much people will be able to buy. A low liquidity level will only allow for small buys. Suggested levels of $500 or more to allow for larger purchase amounts.

**Trading Fee**: Where making a fortune off of trading fees sounds fantastic in reality high fees limit the trades of your token. Consider this when setting the level

**Lock Liquidity**: One of the worse things that happens in the Crypto industry is a “rug pull” where the founder of the token pulls the liquidity. This makes investors in tokens cautious. By locking your LP tokens, you can lower their fears. This shows the liquidity in the token can’t be removed during that time frame. This is a great way to show investors you are serious about the long-term plans for your token.



Planning and preparing to launch your token can take time and energy. It does not guarantee that your token will be successful but it does give it a better shot of making it. How much energy you put in is usually the best plan. Also having partners is also an option to spread the workload. We hope you found this guide useful and we will see you on APEX.
