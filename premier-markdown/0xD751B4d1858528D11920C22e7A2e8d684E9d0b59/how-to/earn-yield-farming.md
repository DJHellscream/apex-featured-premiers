# Earn (Yield Farming)

**Introduction to Staking**

The BIFKNChef contract is a smart contract designed to manage the staking process and distribute rewards to users who provide liquidity to the platform. It ensures that rewards are allocated based on the time and amount of liquidity provided by users. Users can stake both Liquidity Provider (LP) tokens and single-sided tokens directly.

**Key Features**

* **Automated Rewards Distribution**: The contract automates the distribution of rewards based on predefined rules.
* **Decentralized Mechanism**: It operates in a decentralized manner, without the need for intermediaries.
* **Flexible Configuration**: Supports multiple pools for both LP and single-sided staking.
* **Max Apex Functionality**: Claims rewards and auto-stakes the 'Apex' reward token into the single-sided Apex farm.
* Potential Bonus Rewards: Some farms may have bonus rewards added by the project. This will be indicated by a 'bonus' on the farm along with the extra reward that is available.

#### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**How do I check my staking rewards?**

You can check your staking rewards on the Earn page. The interface will display your current rewards for each pool.
