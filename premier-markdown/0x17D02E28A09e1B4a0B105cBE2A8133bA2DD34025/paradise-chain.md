# Paradise Chain Premier

## Gaming Blockchain Innovation on Avalanche L1

Paradise Chain is an Avalanche L1 blockchain positioned to follow the success of gaming giants like Gunzilla ($500M FDV) and Maplestory ($2B FDV). Backed by Avalanche (Ava Labs) and key ecosystem partners, Paradise Chain will launch on Blackhole DEX.

## The Team & Vision

Created by **Empires Not Vampires**, a Finnish game studio established in 2017 by gaming industry veterans, Paradise Chain has been in development for 3 years. The platform connects all Paradise games through next-generation interoperabilityâ€”shared assets, NFTs, crafting systems, progression mechanics, and player-driven events.

**Paradise Legends** is currently in early Alpha, expanding the ecosystem.

- **50% of airdropped tokens** actively spent in-game
- **5+ million trades** during beta phase
