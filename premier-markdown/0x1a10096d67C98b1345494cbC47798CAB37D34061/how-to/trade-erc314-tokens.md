# Trade ERC314 tokens

The ERC314 standard introduces innovative trading functionalities that enhance user experience by simplifying transactions and offering advanced features like built-in Automated Market Maker (AMM) capabilities. This guide explores the various methods available for trading ERC314 tokens, each tailored to different user needs and preferences.

### 1. One-click swaps via direct transfers

**Overview:** Direct transfers involve sending ERC314 or native currency directly to the contract address, which automatically executes the swap all via one-click.

This method is ideal for users who don't want to connect their wallet to a website/dApp and still be able to trade tokens.

**How it Works:**

* **Sending Tokens:** Users can send ERC314 tokens directly to the contract address.
* **Sending Native Currency:** Alternatively, users can send native currency (e.g., AVAX) to the same contract address.

**Benefits**:

* Increased security
* Reduced gas fees
* No need for approvals

**Considerations:**

* It is suited for users looking for quick and straightforward transactions without the need for additional trading interfaces.
* This method includes a default slippage protection of 5%, which might lead to less favorable exchange rates during periods of high volatility or when large orders significantly impact the token's price.

**Steps to Execute a Direct Transfer:**

1. Identify the ERC314 contract address associated with the token you wish to swap.
2. Send the ERC314 tokens or native currency directly to this contract address.
3. The contract automatically processes the swap and sends the corresponding amount of the other currency to your wallet.

### 2. Trading via the APEX Platform
