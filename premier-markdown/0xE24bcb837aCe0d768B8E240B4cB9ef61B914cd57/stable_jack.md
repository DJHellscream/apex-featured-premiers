Stable Jack is a yield, volatility, and points market for any asset. Investors can access fixed and leveraged yield, farm airdrops with leverage, and long any asset without liquidation risk.

As a Sonic Boom and Ethena Accelerator winner, Stable Jack achieved an **80% retention rate** and more than **5,000 users**. With this momentum behind it, Stable Jack is ready to dominate the DeFi ecosystem.

Stable Jack innovates a new tokenomics model, called **Discount Tickets**. This community-first approach limits token inflation and sell pressure through demand-based unlocks, which benefits the long-term holders. Also, as part of **$JACK tokenomics**, the protocol will buy back $JACK from the market with the protocol revenues and share the revenue with $JACK holders.
